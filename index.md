Hi, I’m **Robin Schaefer**, a condensed matter theorist with a focus on frustrated magnetism, dissipative dynamics, and quantum chaos. With a strong computational background, much of my work centers on developing, advancing, and applying cutting-edge numerical methods to address a broad range of questions in quantum many-body physics. Many of these efforts are closely tied to experimental investigations—for example, the search for quantum spin ice behavior in dipolar octupolar pyrochlores.

I hold Master’s degrees in physics and mathematics from TU Dortmund University (2018 and 2019) and completed my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, under the supervision of David Luitz and Roderich Moessner. My dissertation, *Magnetic Frustration in Three Dimensions*, is available [here](https://tud.qucosa.de/landing-page/?tx_dlf[id]=https%3A%2F%2Ftud.qucosa.de%2Fapi%2Fqucosa%253A82937%2Fmets).

My computational efforts have resulted in the development of **DanceQ**, a high-performance C++ library for exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian and Lindbladian systems. It is designed for scalability using OpenMP and MPI and is available [here](https://gitlab.com/DanceQ/danceq).

For a full list of publications, please see my arXiv profile [here](https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0001-9728-2371.html).


Hi, I'm **Robin Schaefer**, a condensed matter theorist interested in frustrated magnetism, dissipative dynamics, and chaos. Haveing a computational background, much is my work focuses on advancing, developing, and applying cutting-edge numerical methods to tackle various questions in quantum many-body systems. Much of my research is experimentally motivated, such as the search for quantum spin-ice physics in dipolar octupolar pyrochlores.

I hold Master's degrees in physics and mathematics from TU Dortmund University (2018 and 2019) and completed my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, working with David Luitz and Roderich Moessner. My dissertation, Magnetic Frustration in Three Dimensions, is available [here, insert Link1 here].

My computationally oriented work led to a high-performance C++ library for exact diagonalization techniques: [DanceQ, insert Link2 here]. It allows scalable OpenMP and MPI operation for Hamiltonian and Lindbladian systems.

Please follow this arXiv [link, insert Link3 here] for all publications.

Currently, I work on the theory of dipolar octupolar pyrochlores, cluster expansions, and quantum Monte Carlo. My C++ library `DanceQ` handles Hamiltonian and Lindbladian dynamics and runs in parallel with OpenMP and MPI.
