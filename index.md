# Hi, I’m **Robin Schaefer**, a condensed matter theorist with a focus on frustrated magnetism, dissipative dynamics, and quantum chaos. With a strong computational background, much of my work centers on developing, advancing, and applying cutting-edge numerical methods to address a broad range of questions in quantum many-body physics. Many of these efforts are closely tied to experimental investigations—for example, the search for quantum spin ice behavior in dipolar octupolar pyrochlores.

# I hold Master’s degrees in physics and mathematics from [TU Dortmund University](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/) and completed my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de/) in Dresden, under the supervision of [David Luitz](https://dluitz.github.io/) and [Roderich Moessner](https://www.pks.mpg.de/moessner). My dissertation, **Magnetic Frustration in Three Dimensions**, is available [here](https://tud.qucosa.de/landing-page/?tx_dlf[id]=https%3A%2F%2Ftud.qucosa.de%2Fapi%2Fqucosa%253A82937%2Fmets).

# My computational efforts have resulted in the development of **DanceQ**, a high-performance C++ library for exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian and Lindbladian systems. It is designed for scalability using OpenMP and MPI and is available [here](https://gitlab.com/DanceQ/danceq).
