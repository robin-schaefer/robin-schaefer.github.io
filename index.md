Hi, I’m **Robin Schaefer**, a condensed matter theorist with a focus on frustrated magnetism, non-equilibrium dynamics, and chaos. With a strong computational background, much of my work centers on developing, advancing, and applying cutting-edge numerical methods to address a broad range of questions in quantum many-body physics. Many of these efforts are closely tied to experimental investigations—for example, the search for quantum spin ice behavior in dipolar octupolar pyrochlores.


My computational efforts have resulted in the development of **DanceQ**, a high-performance C++ library for exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian and Lindbladian systems. It is designed for scalability using OpenMP and MPI. The code and a detailed documentation is available [here](https://gitlab.com/DanceQ/danceq) and [here](https://danceq.gitlab.io/danceq/index.html).
