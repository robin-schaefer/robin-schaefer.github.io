Hi, I’m **Robin Schaefer**, a condensed matter theorist with a focus on frustrated magnetism, dissipative dynamics, and quantum chaos. With a strong computational background, much of my work centers on developing, advancing, and applying cutting-edge numerical methods to address a broad range of questions in quantum many-body physics. Many of these efforts are closely tied to experimental investigations—for example, the search for quantum spin ice behavior in dipolar octupolar pyrochlores.

I hold Master’s degrees in physics and mathematics from TU Dortmund University (2018 and 2019) and completed my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, under the supervision of David Luitz and Roderich Moessner. My dissertation, *Magnetic Frustration in Three Dimensions*, is available [here](https://tud.qucosa.de/landing-page/?tx_dlf[id]=https%3A%2F%2Ftud.qucosa.de%2Fapi%2Fqucosa%253A82937%2Fmets).

My computational efforts have resulted in the development of **DanceQ**, a high-performance C++ library for exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian and Lindbladian systems. It is designed for scalability using OpenMP and MPI and is available [here](https://gitlab.com/DanceQ/danceq).
