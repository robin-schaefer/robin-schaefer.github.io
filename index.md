Hi, I'm **Robin Schaefer**, a condensed matter theorist interested in frustrated magnetism, dissipative dynamics, and quantum chaos.

Currently, I work on the theory of dipolar octupolar pyrochlores, cluster expansions, and quantum Monte Carlo. My C++ library `DanceQ` handles Hamiltonian and Lindbladian dynamics and runs in parallel with OpenMP and MPI.
