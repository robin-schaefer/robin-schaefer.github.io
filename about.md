I did my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems with Roderich Moessner and David Luitz. I currently work at Boston University in the condensed matter theory group.

My research focuses on:

- Magnetic frustration in 3D
- Cluster expansions and tensor networks
- Quantum dynamics in open systems
