Here is a brief overview of my academic background. For the full PDF version, click [here](assets/cv.pdf).

I am currently employed at the [Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/) in the [Department Theory of Novel Quantum Materials](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/forschung/oe/qm/theorie-quantenmaterialien/index_en.html) led by [Johannes Reuther](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/vkart.pl?v=xzuku). Before that, I was Postdoctoral Associate at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), where I was collaborating with [Anatoli Polkovnikov](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/anatoli-polkovnikov/), [Claudio Chamon](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/claudio-chamon/), [Chris Laumann](https://www.bu.edu/physics/profile/christopher-laumann/), and [Anushya Chandra](https://www.bu.edu/physics/profile/anushya-chandran/). My research spans a variety of topics, including dissipative systems, topological order, and various aspects of frustration.

I hold Masterâ€™s degrees in physics and mathematics from [TU Dortmund University](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/) and completed my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de/) in Dresden, under the supervision of [David Luitz](https://dluitz.github.io/) and [Roderich Moessner](https://www.pks.mpg.de/moessner). My dissertation, **Magnetic Frustration in Three Dimensions**, is available [here](https://tud.qucosa.de/landing-page/?tx_dlf[id]=https%3A%2F%2Ftud.qucosa.de%2Fapi%2Fqucosa%253A82937%2Fmets).
